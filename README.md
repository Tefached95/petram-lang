# Petram: Chiseled for Clarity

## What is Petram?

Petram is a general-purpose programming language with verbosity as a feature. It aims to be extremely strict, rigid, but still petraonomic and expressive enough to the point where writing code in it becomes effortless.

**<u>Petram IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY!</u>**

I'm still very much in the middle of refining the syntax and capabilities of the langauge, despite having laid the foundational guidelines. There's not even an implementation yet! It'll be an interpreted language first, and later on it will become compiled, though we might still keep the interpreted version around.

## What is the point of Petram?

**None!** While I would love it if this project saw some adoption, I am fully aware that it's quirky and could definitely be seen as counterintuitive by some. Let me list what Petram is ****not****
  
* It is **NOT** a C killer or anything
* It is **NOT** meant to be extremely popular or to replace any existing workflow
* It is **NOT** meant to cater to already existing languages and their syntactical principles.

I'm developing Petram as a passion project for myself first, and others second. I have firm principles on how it should operate and what its purpose is, and I will maintaint its "quirks" as much as possible (within reason, of course).
It's an excercise in language design, lexing, parsing, and integrating into a compiler backed ([QBE tentatively](https://c9x.me/compile/))

## Is there a summary?

There is! [It's continuously evolving, but you can find the most recent version here.](docs/Petram%20Language%20Specification%20Summary.md).

## Yeah okay, show me some code examples

Go check the [examples folder](examples/). It contains `.petra` files describing its various features.
